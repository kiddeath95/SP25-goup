	<h2>Torvosaurus</h2>
	<p>It resembled a lot like Tyrannosaurus, being a huge carnivorous dinoaur. The main difference was it's arms, as they weren't as small as a Tyrannosaurus, they were rather large and had a large body as well.</p>
	<p>It lived about 145 million years past, in the late Jurassic period of North America, and perhaps Portugal.</p>
	<p>It spanded out from 10 to 12 meters (33 to 40 feet) in length, and weighed from 2 to 5 tonnes (2 to 6 tons).</p>
