		<h1>Torvosaurus</h1>
		<p><strong>Torvosaurus</strong> was a massive carnivorous dinosaur that roamed the Earth during the Late Jurassic period, approximately 145 million years ago. Its fossils have been found in North America, particularly the Morrison Formation, and a related species (Torvosaurus gurneyi) was discovered in Portugal, making it one of the largest land predators in both regions during its time.</p>

        <p>This dinosaur could grow between 10 and 12 meters long (33 to 40 feet) and weigh from 2 to 5 tonnes (2 to 6 tons). Unlike many other large theropods, Torvosaurus had notably powerful forelimbs with large claws — features more developed than in its later relative, the Tyrannosaurus rex.</p>

        <p>Torvosaurus had long, blade-like teeth and a strong jaw structure, well-suited for tearing into prey. It was likely an apex predator, preying on large herbivores like sauropods and stegosaurs in the lush floodplains of the Jurassic landscape.</p>

        <p>The genus name “Torvosaurus” means “savage lizard.” The species was first described in 1979 by Peter Galton and James Jensen, and it remains an important example of predatory evolution prior to the rise of tyrannosaurs.</p>
