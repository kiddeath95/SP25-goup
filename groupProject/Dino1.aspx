		<h1>Irritator</h1>
		<p><strong>Irritator challengeri</strong> was a theropod dinosaur that lived around 110 million years ago during the Early Cretaceous period (Albian stage). Fossils have only been found in the Santana Formation of northeastern Brazil, making it one of the few known spinosaurids from South America.</p>
    
        <p>This dinosaur is estimated to have reached a length of approximately 8 meters (26 feet) and a height of about 3 meters (9 feet), weighing around 1 to 2 tonnes. It likely had a semi-aquatic lifestyle and specialized in eating fish, as suggested by its elongated, narrow skull and conical teeth — features common to members of the Spinosauridae family.</p>
    
        <p>The skull fossil of Irritator was the only known specimen and was unfortunately altered by fossil dealers who tried to make it look more complete, adding plaster and misrepresenting parts of the structure. This tampering caused significant frustration for paleontologists during restoration — which is why it was named “Irritator.”</p>
    
        <p>The species name “challengeri” honors Professor Challenger, a fictional character from Arthur Conan Doyle’s novel <em>The Lost World</em>, emphasizing both the fossil’s difficulty and its scientific intrigue.</p>
